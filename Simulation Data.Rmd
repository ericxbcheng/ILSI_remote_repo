# Objective  

  * To generate simulated data for three sampling strategies (SRS, STRS, SS) with different combinations of `n_contam` and `n_sp`
  
# Method  

1. Load the libraries and functions.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
source("Sampling_libraries.R")
source("Sampling_contamination.R")
source("Sampling_plan.R")
source("Sampling_assay.R")
source("Sampling_outcome.R")
source("Sampling_iteration.R")
source("Sampling_analysis.R")
source("Simulation_data.R")
source("Sampling_visualization.R")
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```


2. List important parameters from previous R files. 

**Contamination:**  

  * `n_contam` = the number of contamination points 
  * `x_lim` = the limits of the horizontal axis  
  * `y_lim` = the limits of the vertical axis  
  * `x` = the horizontal coordinate of the contamination center, which follows a uniform distribution (`U(0,10)`)
  * `y` = the vertical coordinate of the contamination center, which follows a uniform distribution(`U(0,10)`)  
  * `cont_level` = a vector that indicates the mean contamination level (logCFU/g or logCFU/mL) and the standard deviation in a log scale, assuming contamination level follows a log normal distribution $ln(cont\_level)$~$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. 
  * `spread` = the type of spread: `continuous` or `discrete`.

  **Mode 1: Discrete Spread** 

  * `n_affected` = the number of affected plants near the contamination spot, which follows a Poisson distribution (`Pois(lambda = 5)`)   
  * `covar_mat` = covariance matrix of `x` and `y`, which defines the spread of contamination. Assume the spread follows a 2D normal distribution with var(X) =     0.25, var(Y) = 0.25 and cov(X, Y) = 0  

  **Mode 2: Continuous Spread**

  * `spread_radius` = the radius of the contamination spread. 
  * `LOC` = the limit of contribution of contamination. By default, it is set at 0.001.(Both `spread_radius` and `LOC` determine the shape of decay function that describes how much contamination from the source is contributed to a target point.)
  * `fun` = the decay function that describes the spread. It takes either "exp" or "norm".

**Sampling Plan:**  

  * `method_sp` = the sampling method (SRS, STRS, SS)
  * `n_sp` = the number of sampling points
  * `sp_radius` = the radius (m) of a circular region around the sample point. (Only applicable to **Mode 1: Discrete Spread**)
  * `n_strata` = the number of strata (applicable to *Stratified random sampling*)
  * `by` = the side along which the field is divided into strata. It is either "row" or "column" (applicable to *Stratified random sampling*) **OR** the side along which a sample is taken every k steps (applicable to *Systematic sampling*).
  * `m_kbar` = averaged kernel weight (g). By default, it's 0.3 g (estimated from Texas corn).
  * `m_sp` = the analytical sample weight (25 g)
  * `conc_good` = concentration of toxin in healthy kernels
  * `case` = 1 ~ 15 cases that define the stringency of the sampling plan.
  * Attributes plans:
      + `n` = number of analytical units (25g)
      + `c` = maximum allowable number of analytical units yielding positive results
      + `m` = microbial count or concentration above which an analytical unit is considered positive
      + `M` = microbial count or concentration, if any analytical unit is above `M`, the lot is rejected.

**Sampling Assay:**
  
  * `method_det` = method of detection
      + Plating: LOD = 2500 CFU/g
      + Enrichment: LOD = 1 CFU/g

**Iteration:**

  * `n_iter` = the number of iterations per simulation.

```{r}
## We choose "n_contam" to iterate on.
n_contam = rpois(n = 1, lambda = 3)

## Other fixed parameters
## Contamination
x_lim = c(0, 10)
y_lim = c(0, 10)
cont_level = c(7, 1)
spread = "continuous"

### Mode 1
n_affected = rpois(n = 1, lambda = 5)
covar_mat = matrix(data = c(0.25, 0, 0, 0.25), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)

### Mode 2
spread_radius = 1
LOC = 10^(-3)
fun = "exp"

## Sampling plan
method_sp = "srs"
n_sp = 15
sp_radius = 1
n_strata = 5
by = "row"
m_kbar = 0.3
m_sp = 25
conc_good = 0.1
case = 12
m = 0
M = 0
Mc = 20

## Assay
method_det = "enrichment"

## Sampling outcome
n_iter = 100
```

3. Set up the tuning parameters, including `n_contam`, `n_sp`, `method_sp`, and `case`.

  * First layer: We iterate the simulation on 6 values of `n_contam` with a single sampling strategy and a single `n_sp` (and also a single `case` as `n_sp` and `case` are conjugated) for `n_iter`x`n_iter` times. 
  
      * The first `n_iter` iterations produce `r n_iter` binary indicators that can be calculated as 1 probability of detection
      
      * The second `n_iter` iterations produce `r n_iter` probabilities of detection. The same rule applies to probability of acceptance.
  
  * Second layer: We iterate the first layer over 3 values of `method_sp` (i.e. three sampling strategies) with a single `n_sp`
  
  * Third layer: We iterate the second layer over 5 values of `n_sp`
  
  * Note that `n_sp` must be consistent with `case`, otherwise the lot rejection decisions are no longer valid.

```{r}
# First layer
param_name = "n_contam"
vals = c(1,2,3,4,5,6)

# Second layer
strategy_list = c("srs", "strs", "ss")

# Third layer
n_sp_list = c(5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60)
case_list = c(10, 11, 13, 12, 14, 15) # According to the attribute plan
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
temp = data.frame(n_contam = "1:6",
                  n_sp = n_sp_list,
                  n_strata = n_strata,
                  by = by,
                  spread = spread,
                  method_sp = "srs/strs/ss",
                  case = case_list,
                  c = 0, 
                  m = m, 
                  iteration = n_iter*n_iter)

kable_styling(kable(temp, format = "html", 
                    caption = "TABLE. Combinations of input parameters"),
              full_width = FALSE)
```


4. Create a `ArgList` to keep all the default arguments. Then create a function that produces different `ArgList`s for different combinations of input.

```{r}
# A function that produces argument lists for combinations of n_sp and sampling strategies
Set_ArgList
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Set the default arguments list
ArgList = list(n_contam = n_contam, xlim = x_lim, ylim = y_lim, n_affected = n_affected, 
               covar_mat = covar_mat, spread_radius = spread_radius, method_sp = method_sp, 
               n_sp = n_sp, sp_radius = sp_radius, spread = spread, n_strata = n_strata, by = by, 
               cont_level = cont_level, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, m_kbar = m_kbar, m_sp = m_sp, 
               conc_good = conc_good, case = case, m = m, M = M, Mc = Mc, method_det = method_det)

# Produce all the argument lists
ArgList_all = map2(.x = n_sp_list, .y = case_list, .f = Set_ArgList, Args_default = ArgList)
names(ArgList_all) = as.character(n_sp_list)
```

5. Run the simulation once for visualization and debug purposes.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Simple random sampling
one_iter_srs = do.call(what = sim_outcome_temp, args = ArgList_all$`15`$srs) %>% .[[4]]

# Stratified random sampling
one_iter_strs = do.call(what = sim_outcome_temp, args = ArgList_all$`15`$strs) %>% .[[4]]

# Systematic sampling
one_iter_ss = do.call(what = sim_outcome_temp, args = ArgList_all$`15`$ss) %>% .[[4]]
```

6. Iterate the simulations on the third layer.

  * Total number of iteration = `r length(n_sp_list)` x `r length(strategy_list)` x `r length(vals)` x `r n_iter` x `r n_iter`
  
  * Set the seed at 123
  
```{r}
output_rds
```

```{r, eval = FALSE}
pmap(.l = list(Args_default = ArgList_all, sp = n_sp_list, case = case_list), .f = output_rds, seed = 123, n_iter = n_iter, val = vals, name = param_name, contam = "1to6")
```

# Result

1. Read the RDS files.

```{r}
# Find all files with the suffix ".rds"
rds_files = dir(pattern = ".rds")

# Read all the RDS files and save them into rds2var
rds2var = map(.x = rds_files, .f = readRDS)
names(rds2var) = rds_files
```

2. Check the data. There should be 18 RDS files, each containing 100 lists. Each of these lists contains four sub-lists. Each of these sub-lists contains 600 numbers.

```{r}
# The root level
str(rds2var, max.level = 1)

# The primary branch level
str(rds2var[[1]], max.level = 1, list.len = 5)

# The secondary branch level
str(rds2var[[1]][[1]])
```

```{r}
# Check to see if each list in the secondary branch has the correct length. If TRUE is returned, it means at least one list in the branch has different lengths.
f_sec

# Check each list in the primary branch
f_pri

# Check each list in the root level
f_root
```

```{r}
f_root(data = rds2var, length = 600)
```
