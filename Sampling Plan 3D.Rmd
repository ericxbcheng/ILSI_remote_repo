# Objective

  * Add a 3D component to the sampling plan module

# Method

1. Load libraries and source R code.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
source(file = "Sampling_libraries.R")
source(file = "Sampling_contamination.R")
source(file = "Sampling_visualization.R")
source(file = "Sampling_plan.R")
library(plotly)
```

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

2. List important parameters from `Sampling_contamination.R`.

* `n_contam` = the number of contamination points  
* `x_lim` = the limits of the x-axis  
* `y_lim` = the limits of the y-axis  
* `z_lim` = the limits of the z-axis
* `x` = the horizontal coordinate of the contamination center, which follows a uniform distribution by default
* `y` = the vertical coordinate of the contamination center, which follows a uniform distribution by default
* `z` = the vertical coordinate of the contamination center, which follows a uniform distribution by default
* `cont_level` = a vector that indicates the mean contamination level (logCFU/g or logCFU/mL) and the standard deviation in a log scale, assuming contamination level follows a log normal distribution $ln(cont\_level)$~$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. 

** Mode 1: Discrete Spread** 

* `n_affected` = the number of affected kernels near the contamination spot, which follows a Poisson distribution ($Pois(\lambda = 5)$)   
* `covar_mat` = covariance matrix of `x` and `y`, which defines the spread of contamination. Assume the spread follows a 2D normal distribution with var(X) = 0.25, var(Y) = 0.25 and cov(X, Y) = 0   

** Model 2: Continuous Spread**

We do not consider such type of spread in a 3D space. 

```{r}
## The input parameters
n_contam = 3
x_lim = c(0, 10)
y_lim = c(0, 10)
z_lim = c(0, 10)
lims = list(xlim = x_lim, ylim = y_lim, zlim = z_lim)
cont_level = c(7, 1)
spread = "discrete"

### Discrete
n_affected = 3
covar_mat = make_covar_mat(spread = spread, varx = 0.25, vary = 0.25, varz = 0.25, covxy = 0, covxz = 0, covyz = 0)

### Continuous
spread_radius = 1
LOC = 10^(-3)
fun = "exp"
```

```{r}
# Run this if we want reproducibility
set.seed(123)
```

```{r}
# Generate the coordinates of contamination points
contam_xy = sim_contam_new(n_contam = n_contam, lims = lims, spread = spread, covar = covar_mat, n_affected = n_affected, spread_radius = spread_radius, cont_level = cont_level) 
```

```{r}
## Basic info of the contamination simulation
str(contam_xy)

summary(contam_xy$label)
```

3. Define parameters for generating sampling plans.

* `n_sp` = the number of sampling points
* `sp_radius` = the radius (m) of a circular region around the sample point. (Only applicable to **Mode 1: Discrete Spread**)
* `n_strata` = the number of strata (applicable to *2D and 3D Stratified random sampling*)
* `by` = the side along which the field is divided into strata. It is either "row" or "column" (applicable to *2D Stratified random sampling*) **OR** the side along which a sample is taken every k steps (applicable to *2D Systematic sampling*).
* `method_sp` = sampling strategy, including `srs`, `strs`, `ss`.

**Mode 1: Discrete Spread**   
* `m_kbar` = averaged kernel weight (g)
* `m_sp` = the analytical sample weight (25 g)
* `conc_good` = concentration of toxin in healthy kernels

```{r}
n_sp = 15
sp_radius = 2
n_strata = 5
by = "row"
method_sp = "srs"

m_kbar = 0.3
m_sp = 25
conc_good = 0.7 # We could use gen_elisa_af() from STD_simulation.R
```

4. Generate a sampling plan.

    a) `method = "srs"` generates a simple random sampling plan with `n_sp` and `sp_radius`.
    
        i) Sample point coordinates follow a uniform distribution.

    b) `method = "strs"` generates a stratified random sampling plan with `n_sp`, `sp_radius`, `n_strata` and `by`.
    
        i) Check whether `n_sp` is a multiple of `n_strata`.
        
        ii) Divide the field into strata either by row or by column.
        
        iii) Within each stratum, sample point coordinates follow a uniform distribution.
    
    c) `method = "ss"` generates a systematic sampling plan with `n_sp`, `sp_radius` and `by`.
    
        i) Split the field into `N` unit squares ($N = length \times width$).
        
        ii) Calculate `k`. $k = \frac {N} {n_{sp}}$.
        
        iii) In the first unit square, randomly select a sample point whose coordinates follow a uniform distribution.
        
        iv) Generate the rest of the sample points either along the x-axis or y-axis with the equation: $$x = x_0 + (n-1)k, n = 1, 2, ..., n_{sp} $$
        
        v) Arrange the sample points so that they distribute evenly within the field.


```{r}
sp_xy = sim_plan_new(method_sp = method_sp, n_sp = n_sp, spread = spread, lims = lims, radius = sp_radius, by = by, n_strata = n_strata)

str(sp_xy)
```

6. Calculate the contamination level of the sample points. Combine the `sp_xy` and `contam_xy`.

    1) Calculate the Euclidean distance between sample points and contamination points. 
    
    a) **Discrete Spread:**
    
        i) Use the distance to keep the sample points that fall within `sp_radius`.
        
        ii) Calculate the contamination level of each sample point.
        
        $$C_i = \frac {\sum \limits_{j=1}^n C_{ij}\times \bar{m_{k}}} {m_{sp}} = \frac {\bar {m_k}} {m_{sp}} \times [C_{i1} + C_{i2} + ... + C_{ik} + (n_k - k)\times C_{good}] $$ 
        
        , where $C_i$ = contamination level of `sample point i`, 
                        
        $C_{ij}$ = contamination level of `kernel j` in `sample point i`,
        
        $\bar m_k$ = averaged weight of a single kernel,
        
        $m_{sp}$ = weight of an analytical unit,
                        
        $n_k$ = the total number of kernels in an analytical unit, calculated by $\frac {m_{sp}} {\bar m_k}$,
                        
        $k$ = the number of contamination spots or spreads in this sample,
                        
        $C_{good}$ = background contamination level.
        
    b) **Continuous Spread:**
    
        i) Use the distance and decay function to calculate the contamination contribution from each contamination point.
        
        ii) Sum up the contamination contribution from all source points for each sample point.
        
        $$C_{sp_i} = \sum \limits_{j=1}^n C_{cpj} \times f(d_{ij}) =  C_{cp1}\times f(d_{i1})+ C_{cp2}\times f(d_{i2})+ ...+C_{cpn}\times f(d_{in})$$ 
        
        , where $C_{sp_i}$ = contamination level of `sample point i`,  
        
        $C_{cpj}$ = contamination level of `contamination point j` (`j` = 1, 2, ..., n),   
        
        $d_{ij}$ = distance between `sample point i` and `contamination point j`,
        
        $f(d)$ = decay function that calculates the contribution of contamination. When $d_{ij} > spread\_radius$, $f^*(d) = f(d)\times \frac {1} {\mu}$, where $\mu$ is the absolute value of mean contamination level. This process would reduce $C_{sp_i}$ to almost 0.

```{r}
dist_contam_sp = calc_dist(df_contam = contam_xy, df_sp = sp_xy, spread = spread)

contam_sp_xy = gen_sim_data_new(df_contam = contam_xy, spread = spread, df_sp = sp_xy, dist = dist_contam_sp, spread_radius = spread_radius, sp_radius = sp_radius, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, m_kbar = m_kbar, m_sp = m_sp, conc_good = conc_good, cont_level = cont_level)
```

```{r}
kable_styling(kable(x = contam_sp_xy, format = "html"), full_width = FALSE)
```


# Results

1. Overlay the sampling plan on the simulated contamination plot.

```{r}
# Discrete spread in 3D space with a 2D projection
plot_overlay_dis = overlay_draw(method = method_sp, data = contam_sp_xy, spread = "discrete", xlim = lims$xlim, ylim = lims$ylim)
```

```{r}
plot_overlay_dis
```

2. 3D view

```{r, eval = FALSE}
plot_ly(data = subset(contam_sp_xy, subset = label != "sample point"), 
            x = ~X, y = ~Y, z = ~Z, name = "contamination", type = "scatter3d", mode = "markers") %>%
  add_trace(data = subset(contam_sp_xy, subset = label == "sample point"), x = ~X, y = ~Y, z = ~Z, name = "sample", mode = "markers")
```

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "example1.png")
```


```{r, echo= FALSE, eval = FALSE}
contam_level_draw(dimension = "3d", method = fun, spread_radius = spread_radius, LOC = LOC, df_contam = contam_xy, xlim = x_lim, ylim = y_lim, interactive = FALSE)
```
