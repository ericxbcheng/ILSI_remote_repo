```

# Objective

  * This is an instruction for the continuous mode in the sampling model v3.
      + Changes since v2: We adapted some tuning, analysis, and visualization functions from the GUI
  
# Method

###1. Load libraries and source R code.

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
source(file = "Sampling_libraries.R")
source(file = "Sampling_contamination.R")
source(file = "Sampling_contamination_3d.R")
source(file = "Sampling_visualization.R")
source(file = "Sampling_assay_prep.R")
source(file = "Sampling_plan.R")
source(file = "Sampling_plan_3d.R")
source(file = "Sampling_assay_3d.R")
source(file = "Sampling_assay.R")
source(file = "Sampling_outcome_3d.R")
source(file = "Sampling_outcome.R")
source(file = "Sampling_iteration.R")
source(file = "Sampling_tuning_3d.R")
source(file = "Sampling_analysis.R")
```

###2. List important parameters.

**Sampling contamination**

  * `n_contam` = the number of contamination points  
  * `x_lim` = the limits of the x-axis  
  * `y_lim` = the limits of the y-axis  
  * `geom` = the geometric shape of contamination.
      + `point` = point-source contamination
      + `area` = sporadic and systematic contamination
  * `cont_level` = a vector that indicates the mean contamination level (logCFU/g or logCFU/mL) and the standard deviation in a log scale, assuming contamination level follows a log normal distribution $ln(cont\_level)$~$N(\mu, \sigma^2)$. 
  * `bg_level` = background level of microbial contamination (CFU/g)
  * `spread_radius` = the radius of the contamination spread. 
  * `LOC` = the limit of contribution of contamination. By default, it is set at 0.001.(Both `spread_radius` and `LOC` determine the shape of decay function that describes how much contamination from the source is contributed to a target point.)
  * `fun` = the decay function that describes the spread in terms of contamination level. It can be `exp`, `norm`, or `unif`.
      + `exp` = exponential function
      + `norm` = gaussian function
      + `unif` = constant 1 (`LOC` does not affect this)

**Sampling strategies**

  * `method_sp` = sampling strategy, including `srs`, `strs`, `ss`.
  * `n_sp` = the number of sampling points
  * `n_strata` = the number of strata (applicable to *2D Stratified random sampling*)
  * `by` = the side along which the field is divided into strata. It is either "row" or "column" (applicable to *2D Stratified random sampling*) **OR** the side along which a sample is taken every k steps (applicable to *2D Systematic sampling*).

**Sample Assay**
  
  * `m_sp` = individual sample size (g)
  * `method_det` = method of detection  
      + Plating: LOD = 2500 CFU/g  
      + Enrichment: LOD = 1 CFU
  * `case` = 1 ~ 15 cases that define the stringency of the sampling plan.
      + case 1 ~ 9: 3-class plans
      + case 10 ~ 15: 2-class plans
  * Attributes plans:  
      + `n` = number of analytical units 
          - `n` = 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 60
      + `c` = maximum allowable number of analytical units yielding positive results  
      + `m` = microbial count or concentration above which an analytical unit is considered positive  
      + `M` = microbial count or concentration, if any analytical unit is above `M`, the lot is rejected.
        
**Iteration**

  * `n_iter` = the number of iterations

```{r}
## Contamination
n_contam = 1
x_lim = c(0, 30)
y_lim = c(0, 1)
lims = list(xlim = x_lim, ylim = y_lim)
geom = "point"

cont_level = c(3, 1)
bg_level = 0.00001
spread = "continuous"
spread_radius = 1
LOC = 10^(-3)
fun = "exp"

# Sampling
method_sp = "srs"
n_sp = 30
n_strata = c(2,2)
by = "row"

# Assaying
case = 14
m = 0
M = 0
m_sp = 25
method_det = "enrichment"

# Iteration
n_iter = 10

# Wrap arguments into one single list
ArgList_default = list(n_contam = n_contam, lims = lims, spread = spread, spread_radius = spread_radius, 
                       cont_level = cont_level, method_sp = method_sp, n_sp = n_sp, n_strata = n_strata, 
                       by = by, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, case = case, m = m, M = M, m_sp = m_sp, 
                       method_det = method_det, bg_level = bg_level, geom = geom)
```

###3. Set a parameter for tuning and a vector of values to tune over.

  * For example, if you want to tune the parameter `n_contam`, just assign the character "n_contam" to the variable `param_name`, and then assign a vector of tuning values to the variable `vals`.
  
  * Parameters available for tuning:  
      + Continuous parameters: `n_contam`, `spread_radius`, `cont_level`, `n_sp`, `n_strata`, `LOC`, `case`, `m`, `M`, `bg_level`, `m_sp`
      + Categorical parameters: `method_sp`, `by`, `fun`, `method_det`, `geom`
      
  * Some parameters have a finite range of values. Going beyond the allowable range may not produce an error, but it will definitely produce weird results.
  
  * `seed` = the random seed for contamination locations
  
  * `n_seed` = the number of seeds.
  
```{r}
# Calculate the radius of one contamination spot for a specific prevalence
f_radius = function(prev, lims){
  return(sqrt(prev * lims$xlim[2] * lims$ylim[2] / pi))
}

# Calculate prevalence for one contamination spot
f_prev = function(radius, lims){
  return(pi * radius^2 / (lims$xlim[2] * lims$ylim[2]))
}

# Primary tuning parameter
var_prim = "spread_radius"
vals_prim = sapply(X = seq(from = 0, to = 0.1, by = 0.01), FUN = f_radius, lims = lims)

vals_prev = sapply(X = vals_prim, FUN = f_prev, lims = lims)

# Experiment 1
ArgList_ex1_1 = list(n_contam = n_contam, lims = lims, spread = spread, spread_radius = spread_radius, 
                       cont_level = cont_level, method_sp = method_sp, n_sp = 30, n_strata = n_strata, 
                       by = by, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, case = 14, m = m, M = M, m_sp = 25, 
                       method_det = method_det, bg_level = bg_level, geom = geom)

ArgList_ex1_2 = list(n_contam = n_contam, lims = lims, spread = spread, spread_radius = spread_radius, 
                       cont_level = cont_level, method_sp = method_sp, n_sp = 750, n_strata = n_strata, 
                       by = by, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, case = 15, m = m, M = M, m_sp = 1, 
                       method_det = method_det, bg_level = bg_level, geom = geom)

# Experiment 2
ArgList_ex2_1 = list(n_contam = n_contam, lims = lims, spread = spread, spread_radius = spread_radius, 
                       cont_level = cont_level, method_sp = method_sp, n_sp = 750, n_strata = n_strata, 
                       by = by, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, case = 15, m = m, M = M, m_sp = 1, 
                       method_det = method_det, bg_level = bg_level, geom = geom)

ArgList_ex2_2 = list(n_contam = n_contam, lims = lims, spread = spread, spread_radius = spread_radius, 
                       cont_level = cont_level, method_sp = method_sp, n_sp = 75, n_strata = n_strata, 
                       by = by, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, case = 15, m = m, M = M, m_sp = 10, 
                       method_det = method_det, bg_level = bg_level, geom = geom)

ArgList_ex2_3 = list(n_contam = n_contam, lims = lims, spread = spread, spread_radius = spread_radius, 
                       cont_level = cont_level, method_sp = method_sp, n_sp = 25, n_strata = n_strata, 
                       by = by, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, case = 15, m = m, M = M, m_sp = 30, 
                       method_det = method_det, bg_level = bg_level, geom = geom)

ArgList_ex2_4 = list(n_contam = n_contam, lims = lims, spread = spread, spread_radius = spread_radius, 
                       cont_level = cont_level, method_sp = method_sp, n_sp = 10, n_strata = n_strata, 
                       by = by, LOC = LOC, fun = fun, case = 15, m = m, M = M, m_sp = 75, 
                       method_det = method_det, bg_level = bg_level, geom = geom)

# Seeds
n_seed = 10
```

###4. Tune the parameter and produce the following results:

  * `I_det` = Indicator of detection. 
      + 1 = detected
      + 0 = not detected
  * `decision` = a number that indicates lot decision. 
      + 1 = Accept lot. Microbial load < LOD.
      + 2 = Reject lot. At least 1 sample has contamination level >= M.
      + 3 = Reject lot. The number of positive samples is > c.
      + 4 = Accept lot.
  * `param` = the tuning parameter

```{r, warning = FALSE}
sim_data = map(.x = list(ArgList_ex1_1, ArgList_ex1_2), .f = tune_param_n, vals = vals_prim, n_seed = n_seed, n_iter= n_iter, var_prim = var_prim)

sim_data2 = map(.x = list(ArgList_ex2_1, ArgList_ex2_2, ArgList_ex2_3, ArgList_ex2_4), .f = tune_param_n, vals = vals_prim, n_seed = n_seed, n_iter= n_iter, var_prim = var_prim)
```

5. Clean up values of probability of detection and probability of acceptance.

```{r, warning = FALSE}
data_cleaned = metrics_cont_sec(data = sim_data, vals_prim = vals_prim, vals_sec = c("increments", "grab"), n_seed = n_seed)

data_cleaned2 = metrics_cont_sec(data = sim_data2, vals_prim = vals_prim, vals_sec = c("increments", "grab (t = 75, r = 10)", "grab (t = 25, r = 30)", "grab (t = 10, r = 75)"), n_seed = n_seed)
```

# Visualization

###1. Run the model once for visualization purposes.

```{r}
# Remove unnecessary arguments
ArgList_vis = ArgList_default 
ArgList_vis[c("case", "M", "m_sp", "method_det")] = NULL
ArgList_vis$seed = NaN

# Produce intermediate outputs
one_iteration = do.call(what = sim_intmed, args = ArgList_vis)
```

```{r, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%"}
overlay_draw(method_sp = method_sp, data = one_iteration[["contam_sp_xy"]] , spread = spread, xlim = x_lim, ylim = y_lim, n_strata = n_strata, by = by)
contam_level_draw(dimension = "2d", method = fun, spread_radius = spread_radius, LOC = LOC)
contam_level_draw(dimension = "3d", method = fun, spread_radius = spread_radius, LOC = LOC, 
                  df_contam = one_iteration[["contam_sp_xy"]] , xlim = x_lim, ylim = y_lim, bg_level = bg_level, geom = geom)
assay_draw(data = one_iteration[["contam_sp_xy"]] , M = M, m = m, m_sp = m_sp, method_det = method_det, spread = spread, case = case)
```

###2. Visualize the probability of detection and acceptance. 

1. 2 tuning paramters.

```{r}
plot_tune2_ribbon_P_det = function(data, xlab, legend_lab){
  
  # Summarise the data
  a = data %>%
    gather(data = ., key = "metric", value = "value", -c(seed, param, param2)) %>%
    group_by(param2, param, metric) %>%
    summarise(lb = quantile(x = value, probs = 0.025), 
              med = median(x = value),
              ub = quantile(x = value, probs = 0.975)) %>%
    dplyr::filter(metric == "P_det") %>%
    mutate(param_new = f_prev(radius = param, lims = lims))
  
  # Visualize
  b = ggplot(data = a) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(x = param_new, ymin = lb, ymax = ub, group = as.factor(param2), fill = as.factor(param2)), alpha = 0.3) +
    geom_line(aes(x = param_new, y = med, color = as.factor(param2))) +
    geom_point(aes(x = param_new, y = med, color = as.factor(param2))) +
    scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.1)) +
    scale_fill_discrete(name = legend_lab) +
    scale_color_discrete(name = legend_lab) +
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1)) +
    labs(x = xlab, y = "Probability of detection (2.5th - 97.5th percentile)") +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(legend.position = "top")
  
  return(b)
}
```


```{r}
plot_tune2_ribbon_P_det(data = data_cleaned, xlab = "Prevalence", legend_lab = "Sampling scheme")
```

```{r}
plot_tune2_ribbon_P_det(data = data_cleaned2, xlab = "Prevalence", legend_lab = "Sampling scheme")
```
