<h2>Clustering:</h2>
<p><strong>Clusters: </strong>Mycotoxin contamination is not homogeneous throughout the sample. Contamination may be congregated in an area denominated as a &ldquo;cluster&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Cluster Sizes: </strong>When contamination is clustered, it is important to define the size of the cluster</p>
