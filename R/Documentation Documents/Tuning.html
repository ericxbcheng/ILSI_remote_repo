<h2>Turning Parameters</h2>
<p>Refers to the number of parameters (inputs) that may be modified in the model to yield comparable results.</p>
<p><strong>Overall mycotoxin levels:</strong> A series of mycotoxin levels may be defined in with this parameter. Separate the different levels with a comma (&ldquo;,&rdquo;).</p>
<p><strong>Number of probes: </strong>A series of number of probes may be defined in with this parameter. Separate the number of probes with a comma (&ldquo;,&rdquo;). This will allow the user to visualize different results based on the number of probes specified.</p>
<p><strong>Number of grains in cluster: </strong>A series of kernels per cluster may be defined in with this parameter. Separate the number of kernels per cluster with a comma (&ldquo;,&rdquo;). This will allow the user to visualize different results based on the number of kernels per cluster.</p>
<p><strong>Sampling Strategy: </strong>This will allow the user to the effect that different sampling strategies may have on the model outputs.</p>
