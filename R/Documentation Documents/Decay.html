<p><strong>Decay Function</strong></p>
<p>The decay function primarily is based on the geometry of the contamination event. However, to elaborate on these functions, the following examples are provided for each function:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Exponential:</strong> Demonstrates the behavior of the event as a function of distance, by showing decrease/increase of contamination level and detection of the hazard as you sample further/closer from the spot. Example: The closer you are from a fecal pellet; the concentration of bacteria will increase

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Uniform:</strong> This function is usually linked to a widespread contamination event, such as irrigating the field with contaminated water. In this case we assume equal distribution probability of detecting the hazard across the field.
