<p><strong>Radius of contamination area</strong></p>
<p>Given current literature, the maximum spread of pathogen via splash from the fecal pellet is 1.9 m. However, depending on the type of contamination spotted, this radius may be different. If the spotting of the fecal pellet is delayed (i.e. the feces you found were not fresh anymore) and if an irrigation event had occurred within 24 hours before of the finding, consider higher spread/higher contamination level on the edible parts of the produce.</p>
