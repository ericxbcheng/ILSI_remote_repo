<h2>Sampling Methods:</h2>
<p><strong>Simple Random Sampling (SRS):</strong> In a simple random sampling the sampling units (insert our sampling units) are selected using random numbers, all selections of a possible number are equally likely to be selected.</p>
<p><strong>Stratified sampling (STRS):</strong> In stratified sampling the target population is separated into non overlapping (strata) subpopulations that are known to be more homogeneous, this way there is less variation among sampling units in the same (stratum) subpopulation that among sampling units in a different subpopulation.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Systematic Sampling (SS):</strong> In Systematic Sampling, samples are taken at regularly spaced intervals over space. The initial location is chosen at random and then the consequent locations are defined so that all locations are at regular intervals.</p>
